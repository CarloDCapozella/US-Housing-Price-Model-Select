# US_HousingPrice_ModelSelect

The following Python code was used for a data science course project in my graduate studies. The objective of the project was to identify factors that impact the economic increases of the housing market. Using the following dataset found on Kaggle called 'Factors influencing US House Prices', we created regression models to evaluate key predictors in influencing rising house costs.

## Modeling Techniques
